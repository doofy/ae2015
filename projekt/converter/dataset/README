Variable neighborhood search for the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem
"...
CRD and SYM are randomly generated Euclidean problems in complete graphs with up to 100 vertices,
with node degrees in the constrained spanning tree bounded by three.
For both CRD and SYM problem classes, ten instances have been generated for each graph size.
...
STR and SHRD have been generated with the purpose of characterizing more difficult instances.
In series STR, nodes are distributed in clusters within Euclidean spaces of given dimension.
...
The 24 non-euclidean problems in class SHRD are such that there are two instances for each value of |V|=15,20,25,
and 30, and maximum degrees equal to 3, 4, and 5.
..."

All given datasets converted to project format for 2, 3, 4 and 5 degree contraint for every node.
